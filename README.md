=========

Simple, Scalable background processing library for Clojure.

Features

*[Simplicity is Complicated.](https://youtu.be/rFejpH_tAHM)* We've strived to make Goose as simple, transparent & functional as possible.

- A *simple*, *functional* interface
- Flexible - *open* for extension, **closed** for modification
- Lean library, using latest Clojure tooling
- Configurable, with *sane defaults*
- Parallel execution using Java thread-pools
- **Graceful shutdown**
- Tested ðŸ™‚
