Goose: The sidekick for Clojure
=========

Simple, Reliable & Scalable background processing library for Clojure.

Features
---------

*[Simplicity is Complicated.](https://youtu.be/rFejpH_tAHM)* We've strived to make Goose as _simple_ as possible.

- A *functional* interface
- *Reliable* - Code/Hardware/Network failure won't cause data loss
- [Cloud-Native Architecture](https://github.com/nilenso/goose/tree/main/architecture-decisions)
- Lean, Expressive, Transparent & Extensible
- Plug-and-play, minimal setup with *sane defaults*
- Concurrency & Parallelism using Java thread-pools
- Unit & Integration Tests ðŸ™‚

Getting Started
---------

*Note:* Goose will be ready for production usage after completion of [Project 0.2](https://github.com/orgs/nilenso/projects/1/)

### Client

```clojure
(ns my-app
  (:require [goose.client :as c]))

(defn my-background-fn
  [arg1 arg2]
  (println "my-background-fn called with" arg1 arg2))

(c/perform-async c/default-opts `my-background-fn "foo" :bar)
(c/perform-in-sec c/default-opts 3600 `my-background-fn "scheduled" 123)
```

### Worker

```clojure
(ns my-worker
  (:require [goose.worker :as w]))

(let [worker (w/start w/default-opts)]
  ; ... wait for SIGINT or SIGTERM ...
  (w/stop worker))
```


Custom Configuration
---------

Goose provisions custom configuration for Message-Broker, Priority Queues, Scheduling, Error-Handling & Retrying, Logging, & Worker Config.
Details can be found in the respective Wikis ([awaiting completion](https://github.com/nilenso/goose/issues/40)).
